-- ===========================================================================
-- A fight that cannot be written twice.
--
-- Everything about an encounter except cover is last-write-wins. The client
-- computes a whole payload from a bundle it read earlier, and the transaction
-- takes a row lock but no version — so two writers working from the same read
-- both succeed, and the second silently discards the first.
--
-- That was tolerable while a fight advanced roughly once per GM turn. It is not
-- now the board is clickable: combatant `data` carries POSITIONS, and a lost
-- update does not merely stale a number, it teleports a character back to
-- ground they have already left — and every Range DV after that is measured
-- from wherever they are standing.
--
-- Cover already had its own defence: damage only accumulates, so merging by
-- element-wise maximum is idempotent and safe under concurrent writers by
-- construction. Positions have no such property. Going backwards is exactly as
-- representable as going forwards, so nothing about the value itself can tell a
-- stale write from a fresh one. That needs a token.
--
-- `version` starts at 0 and rises by one on every successful save. A caller
-- sends the version it read; if the row has moved on, the write is REFUSED with
-- 'encounter changed' and the client re-reads rather than clobbering.
--
-- The check is OPTIONAL BY DESIGN. A payload with no 'version' key is written
-- unchecked, exactly as today, and still bumps the counter. This is forward-only
-- in the sense that matters for a deployed app: a browser still running the
-- previous bundle keeps working through its fight instead of hitting a wall
-- mid-firefight, and the protection arrives with the client that sends the key.
-- ===========================================================================
ALTER TABLE public.encounters
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS version integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;

COMMENT ON COLUMN public.encounters.version IS
  'Optimistic-concurrency token. Rises by one per successful save_encounter_state. A caller may send the version it read; a mismatch refuses the write.';

-- ===========================================================================
-- save_encounter_state gains the version check.
--
-- Patched from its definition in 20260831020000_cover_state.sql in three
-- places. Every other line — the auth and ownership checks, the cover merge,
-- the range validation, the combatant loop with its campaign scoping and row
-- counts, the vitals, armor and ammunition writes — is byte-identical to what
-- is deployed.
--
--   1. The row lock also reads `version`.
--   2. A payload carrying 'version' must match it, or the write is refused.
--   3. The encounters UPDATE bumps `version`.
--
-- The function still RETURNS void. The new version is always exactly one more
-- than the one that was checked, so the client advances its own token on a
-- successful write rather than needing a return value — which would mean
-- dropping and recreating a function a deployed client is actively calling.
